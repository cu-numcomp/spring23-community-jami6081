    "NonlinearSolve.jl is a package that provides a unified interface for nonlinear solving packages in julia. Also included in this package are two independently developed high performance nonlinear solvers, NewtonRaphson() and TrustRegion(). These solvers are combined with the ability to use sparse automatic differentiation and embedded jacobian vector product calculation to create an environment that allows for easy testing of the effectiveness of alternative solver packages. As of now this package is optimized for small scale problems, it can be used for larger applications but it is likely that performance errors will be experienced. Shown below are some provided examples that can be run to show how the package functions.NonlinearSolve.jl is a package that provides a unified inteface for nonlinear solving packages in julia.
